# Kubernetes Best Practices

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
Define and manage Kubernetes infrastructure using Terraform. 

## RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):
Implement RBAC to control access and follow the principle of least privilege.

## CIS Benchmarks:
Follow the CIS Kubernetes Benchmarks to ensure security compliance and regularly review configurations through audits.

## Network Policies:
Use network policies to control pod communication and enhance security.

## Secrets Management:
Safely manage sensitive data using Kubernetes Secrets or external solutions like HashiCorp Vault.

## Pod Disruption Budgets:
Set budgets to control disruptions during updates and maintain high availability.

## Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA):
Enable HPA to automatically adjust pod counts based on resource utilization.

## Backup and Disaster Recovery:
Implement robust backup and recovery mechanisms for critical data.

## TLS for Communication:
Enforce TLS for secure communication between Kubernetes components and applications.

## GitOps:
Implement GitOps practices for declarative infrastructure management. Use tools like ArgoCD or Flux to automate deployments from Git repositories.

## Monitoring and Logging:
Implement robust monitoring and logging solutions to gain insights into your cluster's performance, troubleshoot issues, and ensure availability.
