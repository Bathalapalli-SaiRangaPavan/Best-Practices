# Project Communication Guidelines

Effective communication is crucial for our workflow. This README outlines guidelines for email communication and best practices to foster collaboration within the team.

## Email Communication Guidelines

1. **Meaningful Subject:**
   Ensure the email subject relates to the Jira story being discussed and is meaningful.

2. **Exclude Jira Numbers:**
   Jira numbers need not be included in the subject line for simplicity.

3. **Include Pull Request Number:**
   Always provide the pull request (PR) number within the email to provide context.

4. **CC the Entire Team:**
   Keep the entire team in the CC field to keep everyone informed about project updates and progress.

5. **Use "Reply All":**
   When responding to an email, click on "Reply All" to ensure all relevant team members receive your response.

6. **Handle Sensitive Information with Care:**
   For emails containing sensitive information or access-related matters, avoid including the entire team in the CC field. Exercise discretion in these cases.

7. **Place Response at the Top:**
   Place your response at the top of the email to ensure it is noticed, not at the bottom.

8. **Friendly Salutations:**
   Address colleagues in a friendly manner without using formal titles. For instance, use greetings like "Hi <name>," such as "Hi Pavan."

By following these guidelines, we enhance the effectiveness and professionalism of our email communication, contributing to a more collaborative and efficient work environment.

## Email Best Practices

### Collaboration

- When seeking help for your story, involve your team by including them in the CC. Collaboration thrives when everyone is on the same page.
- Decide whether to reach out to the entire team, specific individuals, or the manager based on the situation.

### Research and Assessment

- Before sending an email, conduct thorough research to identify your needs.
- Assess what you require precisely, e.g., "Can I get Confluence documentation for the story I am working on?"

### Clarity

- Be specific in your email, clearly stating what you understand and what you are looking for.
- Avoid vague or general requests.

## Avoid Common Mistakes

- Do not use generic greetings like "I hope this email finds you well" in every email. Use them only for initial interactions.
- Keep communication professional but not overly formal.

### Conciseness

- Keep emails concise and to the point. Avoid lengthy, unnecessary content.

### Proofreading

- Double-check your emails for typos and errors before sending.

### Document Links

- Instead of attaching documentation to emails, refer to the relevant Confluence link.
